Customizing My Jekyll Site: Building the Future of Web Tech!

Hey everyone!

I’ve been playing around with Jekyll lately and let me tell you—it’s awesome! For those unfamiliar, Jekyll is a static site generator that makes building websites from simple markdown files a breeze. You don’t need a huge server, and it’s perfect for GitHub Pages, which is exactly what I’m using to host this site.

But what’s even cooler than just building with Jekyll? Editing and customizing it! Today, I wanted to share how I plan on tweaking my own Jekyll site and made it uniquely mine.
What I want to Change:

    Custom CSS - With just a few lines of code, I could be able to update the look and feel of my site. Instead of sticking to the default theme, I want to use a sleek, minimal design—because who doesn’t love a modern, clean aesthetic?
    Plugins - Jekyll has tons of plugins that can supercharge your site. I added the jekyll-feed plugin to generate RSS feeds, which is super handy if I decide to write more blog posts in the future.
